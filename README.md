I have been working as a front end developer for over a decade creating clean and simple user interfaces using atomic design principles. I develop style guides to improve and extend rapid development for FEDs so they can focus more time on development and less time on styling.

Most recently I have expanded my skill set into developing components for AEM, using Sightly (specifically for AEM), JAVA, jQuery and SASS.
